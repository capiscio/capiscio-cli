# Security Policy\n\n## Supported Versions\n\nWe provide security updates for the following versions of Capiscio CLI:\n\n| Version | Supported          |\n| ------- | ------------------ |\n| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |\n\n## Reporting a Vulnerability\n\nWe take the security of Capiscio CLI seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.\n\n### How to Report\n\n**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**\n\nInstead, please report them via email to: security@capiscio.dev\n\nYou should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.\n\n### What to Include\n\nPlease include the following information in your report:\n\n- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)\n- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue\n- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)\n- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue\n- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue\n- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)\n- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue\n\n### Security Considerations\n\nCapiscio CLI is designed with security in mind:\n\n#### Network Security\n- Uses HTTPS by default for all remote requests\n- Implements proper timeout handling to prevent hanging connections\n- Does not store or cache sensitive information\n- Uses standard HTTP headers and follows security best practices\n\n#### Input Validation\n- All JSON input is parsed safely\n- URL validation prevents malicious redirects\n- File path validation prevents directory traversal attacks\n- Input sanitization for all user-provided data\n\n#### Dependencies\n- Minimal dependency footprint to reduce attack surface\n- Regular dependency auditing and updates\n- No external service dependencies that could be compromised\n\n#### Data Handling\n- No persistent storage of validated agent cards\n- No transmission of sensitive data to external services\n- All validation is performed locally\n\n## Vulnerability Response\n\nWhen we receive a security bug report, we will:\n\n1. **Acknowledge** receipt of your report within 48 hours\n2. **Assess** the vulnerability and determine its impact\n3. **Develop** a fix for the issue\n4. **Test** the fix thoroughly\n5. **Release** a patch version as soon as possible\n6. **Notify** the community about the security update\n\n### Timeline\n\n- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Patch within 7 days\n- **High vulnerabilities**: Patch within 14 days\n- **Medium/Low vulnerabilities**: Patch in next regular release\n\n### Credit\n\nWe believe in giving credit to security researchers who help make our software safer. If you report a security vulnerability, we will:\n\n- Credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)\n- Include your name in the CHANGELOG for the release that fixes the issue\n- Provide a brief description of your contribution\n\n## Security Best Practices for Users\n\n### When Using Capiscio CLI\n\n1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version of Capiscio CLI\n2. **Verify Sources**: Only validate agent cards from trusted sources\n3. **Network Security**: Be cautious when validating URLs from untrusted sources\n4. **File Permissions**: Ensure proper file permissions on agent card files\n5. **CI/CD Security**: Use JSON output mode in automated environments\n\n### In Production Environments\n\n1. **Use Strict Mode**: Enable strict validation for production deployments\n2. **Network Isolation**: Consider running validation in isolated environments\n3. **Logging**: Monitor validation logs for suspicious activity\n4. **Access Control**: Limit who can run validation commands in production\n\n### For Developers\n\n1. **Validate Input**: Always validate agent cards before deployment\n2. **Use HTTPS**: Ensure agent cards are served over HTTPS\n3. **Content Security**: Implement proper Content-Security-Policy headers\n4. **Regular Audits**: Regularly audit your agent card configurations\n\n## Scope\n\nThis security policy applies to:\n\n- The Capiscio CLI codebase\n- npm package distribution\n- GitHub repository and releases\n- Documentation and examples\n\nThis policy does not cover:\n\n- Third-party agent cards validated by the CLI\n- External services that agent cards may reference\n- User-specific configurations or environments\n\n## Contact\n\nFor general security questions (not vulnerability reports), please contact:\nsecurity@capiscio.dev\n\nFor urgent security matters, you may also reach out via:\n- GitHub Security Advisory (for confirmed vulnerabilities)\n- Direct message to maintainers (for clarification only)\n\n## Legal\n\nBy reporting security vulnerabilities, you agree that:\n\n- You will not access, modify, or delete data belonging to others\n- You will not perform any attacks that could harm the reliability or integrity of our services\n- You will not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had time to address it\n- Your testing and research comply with applicable laws\n\n---\n\nThank you for helping keep Capiscio CLI and our users safe!\n
